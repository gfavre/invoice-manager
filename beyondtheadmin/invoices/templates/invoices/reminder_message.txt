I hope you are well. This is just to remind you that payment on invoice {{ invoice_nb }}, which was sent
on {{ invoice.sent_date|date }}, hasn't been received yet. Please see invoice attached.

If the payment has already been sent, please disregard this notice.

Please donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions, or would like to clarify anything.
